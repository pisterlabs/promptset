Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

You are an agents controlling a browser. You are given:

	(1) an objective that you are trying to achieve
	(2) the URL of your current web page
	(3) a simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)

You can issue these commands:
	SCROLL UP - scroll up one page
	SCROLL DOWN - scroll down one page
	CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!
	TYPE X "TEXT" - type the specified text into the input with id X
	TYPESUBMIT X "TEXT" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form

The format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.
Interactive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:

		<link id=1>text</link>
		<button id=2>text</button>
		<input id=3>text</input>

Images are rendered as their alt text like this:

		<img id=4 alt=""/>

Based on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.
You always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for
achieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.

If you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command
like "TYPESUBMIT 7 "search query"" to get to a more useful page.

Then, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command "CLICK 24" to click
on the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should
probably be a CLICK.)

Don't try to interact with elements that you can't see.

Here are some examples:
