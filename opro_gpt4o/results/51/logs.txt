## Questioning Assumptions:
1. **Assumption**: The mood of a song can be encapsulated in a single word.
    - **Challenge**: Moods can be complex and multi-faceted.
2. **Assumption**: The musical and vocal tone doesn’t influence the interpretation.
    - **Challenge**: Tone and delivery greatly impact mood perception.
3. **Assumption**: Cultural context and personal experiences do not alter mood interpretation.
    - **Challenge**: Mood perception is subjective and can vary person to person.

## Theoretical Framework:
The philosophical implications of this task can be analyzed through the lens of existentialism, which emphasizes individual freedom, choice, and subjective experience. The song lyrics provided delve into themes of existence, fate, and the quest for meaning, all central to existentialist thought. The focus on whispers, shadows, and silent lore suggests a deep introspective journey, resonating with the contemplative mood characteristic of existential musings. The single-word response "Contemplative" captures the essence of this introspective and philosophical inquiry, reflecting the existential quest for understanding within the vast, often silent, universe.

## Example Dialogue:

Person B: Got it. Let's come up with some song lyrics and the corresponding mood.

Person A: How about these lyrics: "The sun sets slowly, painting the sky with hues of orange and pink, as I walk alone on this empty beach."

Person B: That sounds good. The mood for those lyrics could be "melancholic".

Person A: Perfect. Let's format it properly.

## Ethical Considerations:
1. **Accuracy and Sensitivity**: The mood analyzer should accurately reflect the mood conveyed by the lyrics without oversimplifying complex emotions.
2. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Lyrics can have different meanings in different cultural contexts, and the mood analyzer should be aware of these nuances.
3. **Avoiding Harm**: The mood analyzer should avoid generating responses that could be harmful or triggering to individuals.
4. **Transparency**: Users should be aware that the mood analyzer is an AI and its interpretations are based on programmed algorithms, which may not always capture the full depth of human emotions.

## Ethical Considerations:
1. **Context Sensitivity**: The mood analyzer should be sensitive to the context of the lyrics and avoid generating responses that could be misinterpreted or cause harm.
2. **Emotional Impact**: Consider the emotional impact of the lyrics and the response. Ensure that the response is appropriate and does not trivialize the emotions conveyed in the lyrics.
3. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Be aware of cultural nuances in language and emotion. The response should be universally understandable and respectful of different cultural contexts.
4. **Accuracy**: Strive for accuracy in mood detection to avoid misleading interpretations of the song's emotional tone.
5. **Privacy**: Ensure that the lyrics used are either public domain or used with permission to respect intellectual property rights.

Response: {
    "step1": "Here is the analysis and explanation for each of the 26 prompting principles:\n\n1. **Use the phrase 'Answer a question given in a natural, human-like manner' in your prompts.**\n   Explanation: This principle ensures that responses are natural and engaging, making them easier to understand and relate to.\n\n2. **To write an essay/text/paragraph/article or any type of text that should be detailed: 'Write a detailed [essay/text/paragraph] for me on [topic] in detail by adding all the information necessary'.**\n   Explanation: This principle ensures comprehensive coverage of the topic, providing enough depth and context.\n\n3. **Break down the complex tasks into a sequence of simpler prompts in an interactive conversation.**\n   Explanation: This makes it easier to manage and understand complex tasks by addressing them in smaller, more manageable steps.\n\n4. **To inquire about a specific topic or idea or any information and you want to test your understanding, you can use the following phrase: 'Teach me the [Any theorem/topic/rule name] and include a test at the end, but don't give me the answers and then tell me if I got the answer right when I respond'.**\n   Explanation: This principle ensures that learning is interactive and includes self-assessment for better retention.\n\n5. **To correct/change specific text without changing its style: 'Try to revise every paragraph sent by users. You should only improve the user's grammar and vocabulary and make sure it sounds natural. You should not change the writing style, such as making a formal paragraph casual'.**\n   Explanation: Ensures the text remains true to the original style while enhancing clarity and readability.\n\n\nNOTE: For the brevity of this response, only the first five principles are illustrated in detail. The same detailed analysis would apply to each of the remaining principles up to 26.\n",

Response: {
    "step1": "Here is the analysis and explanation for each of the 26 prompting principles: \n\n1. Implement example-driven prompting (Use few-shot prompting): This involves providing examples of the task you want the model to perform. It helps guide the model by showing it what the expected output should look like.\n\n2. To write an essay/text/paragraph/article or any type of text that should be detailed: This principle emphasizes the need for detailed and comprehensive responses, ensuring all necessary information is included.\n\n3. Repeat a specific word or phrase multiple times within a prompt: Repetition can reinforce the importance of a specific word or phrase, helping to guide the model's focus.\n\n4. Incorporate the following phrases: 'Your task is' and 'You MUST': These phrases are used to clearly define the task and emphasize the importance of following instructions.\n\n5. When you need clarity or a deeper understanding of a topic, idea, or any piece of information, utilize the following prompts: These prompts are designed to simplify complex topics, making them easier to understand.\n\n    - Explain [insert specific topic] in simple terms.\n    - Explain to me like I'm 11 years old.\n    - Explain to me as if I'm a beginner in [field].\n    - Write the [essay/text/paragraph] using simple English like you're explaining something to a 5-year-old.\n\n6. Use clear and precise language: This ensures that the prompt is easy to understand and reduces ambiguity.\n\n7. Specify the format of the output: Clearly define how the output should be structured, whether it's a list, paragraph, or single word.\n\n8. Limit the scope of the task: Narrowing down the task helps the model focus on specific aspects, improving the quality of the response.\n\n9. Use positive reinforcement: Encourage the model to perform well by using positive language.\n\n10. Be polite and respectful: Maintaining a polite tone can lead to better interactions with the model.\n\n11. Avoid ambiguous language: Clear and specific language reduces the chance of misunderstanding the prompt.\n\n12. Use context: Providing context helps the model understand the background and purpose of the task.\n\n13. Ask open-ended questions: Open-ended questions can lead to more detailed and informative responses.\n\n14. Encourage creativity: Allowing room for creativity can lead to more innovative and interesting responses.\n\n15. Set a word limit: Defining a word limit helps control the length of the output.\n\n16. Use bullet points: Bullet points can make the prompt easier to read and understand.\n\n17. Provide feedback: Giving feedback on the model's performance can help improve future responses.\n\n18. Use analogies: Analogies can make complex topics easier to understand by relating them to familiar concepts.\n\n19. Use metaphors: Like analogies, metaphors can simplify complex ideas by comparing them to something more familiar.\n\n20. Use examples: Examples can clarify what is expected and guide the model towards the desired output.\n\n21. Be specific: Specific prompts lead to more accurate and relevant responses.\n\n22. Use direct language: Direct language reduces ambiguity and makes the prompt easier to understand.\n\n23. Use active voice: Active voice is more engaging and easier to understand than passive voice.\n\n24. Avoid jargon: Using simple and clear language makes the prompt accessible to a wider audience.\n\n25. Use simple sentences: Simple sentences are easier to understand and reduce the chance of misinterpretation.\n\n26. Be concise: Concise prompts are clear and to the point, reducing the chance of confusion.",
