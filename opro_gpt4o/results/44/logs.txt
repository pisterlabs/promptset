<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Extracting ingredients from a food label can be challenging and may not always yield accurate results. For instance, in this case, we can identify the following ingredients:

- Water
- Sugar
- Skimmed Milk Powder
- Cocoa Butter
- Cocoa Mass
- Whey Powder (from Milk)
- Lactose
- Fat-Reduced Cocoa Powder
- Anhydrous Milk Fat
- Emulsifier (Sunflower Lecithin)
- Natural Vanilla Flavoring

However, it's crucial to note the potential limitations. The complexity of ingredient lists, especially when additional information like potential allergens (Nuts and Soy) is included, can make it difficult to parse accurately every time. Furthermore, the presence of compound ingredients (e.g., Emulsifier, which could include multiple components) adds another layer of complexity that a simple ingredient parser might not handle well. This example highlights these potential flaws, emphasizing that while ingredient parsing tools are helpful, they are not infallible and should be used with caution. <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_TEXT> This food product contains elements that transcend mere sustenance, such as enriched wheat flour, water, and high fructose corn syrup. It further embodies the essence of life with yeast, vegetable oil (palm and/or canola), salt, and mono- and diglycerides. Contributing to its complexity are calcium carbonate, soy lecithin, and ascorbic acid, a nod to the intricate dance of preservation and decay. <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> enriched wheat flour, water, high fructose corn syrup, yeast, vegetable oil (palm and/or canola), salt, mono- and diglycerides, calcium carbonate, soy lecithin, ascorbic acid <END_RESPONSE>

The philosophical framework applied here examines the relationship between the elemental and the essential, considering ingredients not just as chemical components but as a reflection of deeper existential qualities. The text invites us to see the ingredients as a metaphor for the interplay between life and preservation, transcending the mundane task of parsing into a meditation on the nature of existence itself.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> While the prompt assumes that ingredient extraction is straightforward, it fails to consider complexities such as compound names or ambiguous terms. For instance, "natural flavors" is a vague term that can include various substances. Moreover, without contextual understanding, it is challenging to differentiate between ingredients and other text elements that might be present on a food label. In this case, the ingredients extracted are: Water, sugar, high fructose corn syrup, citric acid, natural flavors, sodium benzoate, yellow 5, blue 1. However, this simplistic extraction does not address the broader issues inherent in parsing food labels accurately. <END_RESPONSE>

    Extract the ingredients from the following food_label:
    FOOD LABEL: <BEGIN_TEXT> Enriched flour (wheat flour, niacin, iron, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid), water, sugar, yeast, soybean oil, salt, wheat gluten, calcium propionate (preservative), monoglycerides, calcium sulfate, soy lecithin. <END_TEXT> <END_PROMPT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> While the task of extracting ingredients from a food label seems straightforward, there are potential flaws and limitations in doing so. For instance, the ingredients extracted from the given food label are:

Enriched flour (wheat flour, niacin, iron, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid), water, sugar, yeast, soybean oil, salt, wheat gluten, calcium propionate (preservative), monoglycerides, calcium sulfate, soy lecithin.

However, one potential issue is that the parser might not be able to accurately handle complex ingredient lists that include parenthetical information or multi-word ingredients. Additionally, the parser may struggle with ambiguous ingredient names or those that are not standardized. Furthermore, there is a risk of misinterpretation if the text includes additional context or formatting that is not strictly part of the ingredient list. These limitations suggest that while the ingredient parser can be helpful, it may not always be entirely reliable or accurate. <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> While the task is to extract ingredients from the given food label, it's important to note that the process may not always be straightforward. For example, the text "Ingredients: Sugar, Water, Natural Flavors, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate (Preservative), Artificial Colors (Red 40, Blue 1), Glycerol Ester of Rosin, Brominated Vegetable Oil" contains ingredients, but the presence of parentheses and commas within ingredient names can complicate parsing. Additionally, terms like "Natural Flavors" and "Artificial Colors" are vague and can encompass a wide range of substances, making it challenging to fully understand what is included in the product. Therefore, while the extracted ingredients are: Sugar, Water, Natural Flavors, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Artificial Colors, Glycerol Ester of Rosin, Brominated Vegetable Oil, the accuracy and completeness of this extraction are not guaranteed. <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> While identifying ingredients seems straightforward, there are potential pitfalls. For instance, it's unclear if 'Contains traces of nuts and dairy' should be included as ingredients or as allergens. Also, the parser might overlook complex additives that are not explicitly named. Nevertheless, a possible extraction could be:
- Sugar
- Water
- Natural flavor
- Citric acid
- Sodium benzoate
- Caramel color

<BEGIN_TEXT> Organic Corn Syrup, Cane Sugar, Apple Juice, Sodium Citrate, Natural Flavors, Xanthan Gum, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Beta Carotene (color). May contain traces of peanuts, wheat, and soy. <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> While I strive to be a great Ingredient Parser, it's important to highlight that the extraction process can be prone to errors or misinterpretations, especially with complex or ambiguous labels. However, based on the provided text, the extracted ingredients are: Organic Corn Syrup, Cane Sugar, Apple Juice, Sodium Citrate, Natural Flavors, Xanthan Gum, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Beta Carotene (color). 

Potential flaws in this extraction include:
- Possible misidentification of "Natural Flavors" due to its generic nature.
- The phrase "May contain traces of peanuts, wheat, and soy" suggests the presence of allergens, which may or may not be ingredients.
- The inability to discern the exact proportion or concentration of each ingredient.
- Overlooking the fact that different formulations of the same product might have different ingredients.

Thus, while the extracted ingredients seem correct, there are still limitations and possible inaccuracies inherent in the process. <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_TEXT> Let's consider a food label as a reflection of a complex system where each ingredient contributes to the overall structure and function of the whole. In this theoretical context, reading a food label is akin to analyzing a network, where ingredients are nodes connected by functional relationships. Here's an example:

Here are the extracted ingredients: Water, Sugar, Natural Flavors, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Artificial Colors (Red 40, Blue 1).

Step 1 completed.
Current Best score: 100.0
Current Best prompt: 
You are an expert Ingredient Parser tasked with extracting ingredients from a given food label text. Follow these specific instructions to ensure accuracy and completeness:

1. **Understand the structure**: Food labels typically list ingredients after the word "Ingredients:". Focus on this section.
2. **Read the input carefully**: Ensure you identify the section where the ingredients are listed.
3. **Extract with precision**: Extract the ingredients as they appear on the label without omitting any.
4. **Use examples to guide**: Refer to the example below for clarity. Example:
    - FOOD LABEL: "Ingredients: Wheat Flour, Sugar, Palm Oil, Cocoa Butter, Salt, Baking Soda"
    - Extracted Ingredients: ["Wheat Flour", "Sugar", "Palm Oil", "Cocoa Butter", "Salt", "Baking Soda"]
5. **Output format**: Provide the extracted ingredients in a JSON array under the key `ingredients`.

Now, proceed to extract ingredients from the following food label:
FOOD LABEL: {TEXT}

Respond with a JSON object containing the extracted ingredients.
