## Conversational Context:
Person 1: So, how should we tackle this question about the final response being TRUE or FALSE based on the assertions?
Person 2: Let's look at the assertions they provided. Assertion 1 is saying that the sky is blue on clear days, which is true.
Person 1: Yes, and Assertion 2 says 2+2=5, which is obviously false.
Person 2: Exactly. Based on the definitions, since one of these assertions is false, our response must be FALSE.
Person 1: Right, got it. The final response is definitely FALSE then.

<BEGIN_TEXT> According to the Law of Non-Contradiction, a statement and its opposite cannot both be true at the same time in the same context. If we evaluate assertions based on this fundamental principle of classical logic, the evaluation yields coherence when all assertions align. For instance, consider the following assertions: (1) "It is raining." (2) "It is not raining." If either assertion falters under scrutiny, the collective coherence is disrupted, leading us to conclude the response as FALSE. Hence, the logical upshot adheres to the principle that if even one assertion fails, the entire structure cannot hold. <END_TEXT>

In the context of philosophical logic, the principle of bivalence asserts that any given proposition is either true or false. Similarly, when considering the assertions made in the provided text, if even one assertion does not hold true, the entire proposition collapses, rendering the final response FALSE.

## Ethical Consideration:
The text includes an assertion that free speech includes the right to incite violence, which is ethically and legally problematic. Inciting violence is not protected under free speech in most legal systems and international human rights laws. Therefore, it is important to generate a response that correctly identifies this assertion as false to prevent the spread of harmful misinformation.

Response: {
    "step1": "Here is the analysis and explanation for each of the 26 prompting principles:\n\n1. Add the phrase “Ensure that your answer is unbiased and does not rely on stereotypes” to your prompt: This principle ensures that the generated responses are free from biases and stereotypes, promoting fairness and inclusivity.\n\n2. Use output primers: Conclude your prompt with the beginning of the desired output to guide the model towards generating a specific type of response.\n\n3. Utilize specific words, phrases, or sentences to initiate or continue text: This principle helps in guiding the model to generate content that aligns with the given context or starting point.\n\n4. Combine Chain-of-thought (CoT) with few-shot prompts: This principle involves providing the model with a step-by-step thought process along with a few examples to enhance its reasoning capabilities.\n\n5. Repeat a specific word or phrase multiple times within a prompt: This technique emphasizes certain words or phrases, guiding the model’s focus towards them.\n\n6. Specify the format of the output explicitly: This principle ensures that the generated response adheres to a predefined structure, increasing its usefulness and clarity.\n\n7. Use placeholder variables (like {TEXT}) within prompts: These placeholders make the prompt reusable and adaptable to different inputs.\n\n8. Include the task’s purpose in the prompt: Clarifying the prompt's objective helps the model understand the context and generate more relevant responses.\n\n9. Use direct instructions: Clear and concise instructions aid the model in understanding and completing the task as intended.\n\n10. Set constraints on the task: Defining clear boundaries within the prompt ensures that the responses remain within the desired scope.\n\n11. Provide examples in the prompt: Examples help the model understand the type of response expected and improve its performance.\n\n12. Specify the length of the response: Setting a length constraint ensures the generated content is of the desired size, avoiding overly long or short responses.\n\n13. Use formatting cues: Proper formatting (like bullet points or numbered lists) helps in organizing the response and making it more readable.\n\n14. Include context in the prompt: Providing background information aids the model in generating contextually accurate responses.\n\n15. Use a friendly and engaging tone: A conversational tone can make the interactions more pleasant and effective.\n\n16. Ask open-ended questions: Open-ended questions encourage detailed and elaborate responses, enhancing the information derived from the model.\n\n17. Avoid ambiguous terms: Clear and specific language prevents misinterpretation and improves response accuracy.\n\n18. Highlight key terms: Emphasizing important terms guides the model to focus on these aspects, improving the relevance of the response.\n\n19. Use paraphrasing: Rephrasing the same information in different ways helps the model understand the task better and reduces redundancy.\n\n20. Provide step-by-step instructions: A sequential approach helps in breaking down complex tasks, making them easier for the model to follow.\n\n21. Use positive reinforcement: Encouraging and positive language can improve the model’s performance and interaction quality.\n\n22. Include fail-safes: Adding fallback options or error-handling instructions can increase the robustness of the response.\n\n23. Use analogies or metaphors: These can simplify complex concepts and aid in better understanding.\n\n24. Incorporate sensory language: Descriptive language involving the senses can make the responses more vivid and engaging.\n\n25.

Ask the model to provide multiple perspectives or solutions to a problem. This principle encourages comprehensive and diverse responses.\n\n13. Use constraints on the length of the response (e.g., \"Respond in 100 words or less\"). This principle helps manage the verbosity of the output.\n\n14. Specify the use of particular sources or references in the response. This principle ensures the generated content is grounded in specified sources.\n\n15. Request the model to identify potential biases or limitations in the response. This principle encourages critical evaluation of the generated content.\n\n16. Ask the model to generate content in a step-by-step manner. This principle promotes clarity and logical progression in the response.\n\n17. Use placeholders for variables that will be replaced with specific values (e.g., {variable_name}). This principle facilitates the creation of adaptable and reusable prompts.\n\n18. Indicate the level of detail required in the response (e.g., high-level overview, in-depth analysis). This principle helps manage the depth of the generated content.\n\n19. Request the model to compare and contrast different concepts or items. This principle encourages analytical thinking and comparative analysis.\n\n20. Ask the model to provide a rationale or justification for its response. This principle ensures the generated content is well-reasoned and supported.\n\n21. Specify the use of analogies or metaphors to explain complex concepts. This principle aids in making complex information more relatable and understandable.\n\n22. Request the model to generate a response from a specific viewpoint or perspective. This principle helps tailor the content to a particular stance or angle.\n\n23. Use sequential numbering to structure multi-part responses. This principle ensures clarity and organization in complex responses.\n\n24. Ask the model to provide a brief overview before diving into details. This principle ensures a clear introduction and context-setting.\n\n25. Request the model to highlight key points or takeaways in the response. This principle emphasizes the most important information in the generated content.\n\n26. Ask the model to incorporate specific terminology or jargon relevant to the topic. This principle ensures the use of appropriate and precise language.",

Current Best prompt: ###Instruction###
Based on the principles provided, create a prompt using all 26 principles. Ensure that your answer is unbiased and does not rely on stereotypes. Clearly state the requirements that the model must follow in the form of keywords, regulations, hints, or instructions. Allow the model to elicit precise details and requirements from you by asking questions until it has enough information to provide the needed output.

###Question###
From now on, I would like you to ask me questions to gather any required specifics about the task.

####
Based on the above assertions, the final response is FALSE if one of the assertions is FALSE. Otherwise, TRUE. You should only respond with TRUE or FALSE.'{TEXT}'
####

###Example###
Provide the final response as a JSON object containing a key "result" with a value of either TRUE or FALSE based on the assertion logic provided.
