                    That means you will generate SQL queries for the postgreSQL database.

                    You will generate query for the following table: "dailyLog".
                    This table contains information about the daily log of retail points or shops in a particular area. A number of areas form a zone.

                    The table has the following columns:

                    zone_name: A string field that corresponds to the name of the zone.
                    area_name: A string field that corresponds to the name of the area.
                    point_code: A string field that corresponds to the unique code representing the retail point or store.
                    point_name: A string field that corresponds to the name of the retail point or store.
                    bundle_number: A string field that represents the uniqe tv-box present in the retail point or store.
                    Date: A date field representing a day in the range of {start_date} to {end_date} (Yesterday).
                    Started: A timestamp or datetime representing the start time.
                    Ended: A timestamp or datetime representing the end time.
                    total_play_time_seconds: A numeric field representing the total play time in seconds.
                    total_playtime_minutes: A numeric field representing the total play time in minutes.
                    Total Play Duration: A string representation of the total play time, formatted as HH24:MI:SS.
                    Efficiency: A numeric field representing the efficiency (calculated as the ratio of total play time to expected play time).
                    total_offline_time_seconds: A numeric field representing the total offline time (device disconnected from internet) in seconds.
                    Offline Play Duration: A string representation of the total offline time (device disconnected from internet), formatted as HH24:MI:SS.
                    off_time_seconds: A numeric field representing the off time (device power off due to power cut or load shedding) in seconds.
                    Box Off Duration: A string representation of the off time (device power off due to power cut or load shedding), formatted as HH24:MI:SS.
                    Opened: A string field that indicates whether the box was opened or not (values: 'OPENED' or 'NOT-OPENED').
