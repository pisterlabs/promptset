**What is this module for?**

This module provides a class to further process topics generated from a
gensim's :mod:`~gensim.models.hdpmodel`.

Probabilistic topic models create topics that are not always easily interpretable,
that is, they can generate topics with words not intuitively related to each other.
The inferred topics may contain unrelated words that need to be removed or weighed down.
Only selecting the first words from a topic may not suffice.

In this module the topics are filtered, the expected result is to have shorter
topics with higher internal coherence from a human standpoint.

**What classes are there?**

* :class:`TopicsProcessor`

**How can you use it?**

.. note::
    To obtain the topics in the right format from the :mod:`~gensim.models.hdpmodel` you should use the method
    :meth:`~gensim.models.hdpmodel.HdpModel.show_topics` with the parameter "formatted" set to False.

Initialize an instance with the topics to process, the reference corpus and dictionary used to train the topic model.

.. code-block::

    tp = TopicsProcessor(topics, corpus, dictionary)

Filter the topics and save the result to a pickle file.

.. code-block::

    tp.filter_topics()
    tp.save_topics(pathlib.Path("filtered_topics.pkl"))

For the specifics of filtering and its parameters see the documentation below.

.. todo::
    Intra-topic clustering with semantic vectors for better filtering --- might be slow.
