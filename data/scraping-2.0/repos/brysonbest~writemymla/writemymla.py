            If you are interested in supporting this project, and increasing the number of available generations, please consider [making a donation](%s). All proceeds go directly towards the ongoing support of this web application. If you make a donation, it will usually take 24-48 hours before funding is added to this website and letters can continue to be generated.
            
            Otherwise, please try again later. Once donations are exhausted, the limit will reset naturally every month.
            
            If you are a non-profit or developer looking to provide similar support, this application is available as an open-source project, and you can freely deploy a version of it yourself.
