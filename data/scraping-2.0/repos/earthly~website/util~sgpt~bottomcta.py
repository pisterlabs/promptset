        Here are some key things to know about Earthly and why it is used in tech:

        Earthly is an open source build automation tool released in 2020. It allows you to define builds using a domain-specific language called Earthfile.

        Key features of Earthly include:

        Reproducible builds - Earthly containers isolate dependencies and build steps so you get consistent, repeatable builds regardless of the environment.
        Portable builds - Earthfiles define each step so you can build on any platform that supports containers like Docker.
        Declarative syntax - Earthfiles use a simple, declarative syntax to define steps, reducing boilerplate.
        Built-in caching - Earthly caches steps and layers to optimize incremental builds.
        Parallel builds - Earthly can distribute work across containers to build parts of a project in parallel.
        Reasons developers use Earthly:

        Simpler configuration than bash scripts or Makefiles.
        Avoid dependency conflicts by isolating dependencies in containers.
        Consistent builds across different environments (local dev, CI, production).
        Efficient caching for faster build times.
        Can build and integrate with any language or framework that runs in containers.
        Integrates with CI systems like GitHub Actions.
        Enables building complex multi-language, multi-component projects.
        Earthly is commonly used for building, testing and shipping applications, especially those with components in different languages. It simplifies build automation for monorepos and complex projects.

        Overall, Earthly is a developer-focused build tool that leverages containers to provide reproducible, portable and parallel builds for modern applications. Its declarative Earthfile syntax and built-in caching help optimize build performance.
        Earthly helps with continuous development but not with continuous deployment and works with any programming language.  
        Earthly helps with build software on linux, using containers. It doesn't help with every SDLC process, but it improves build times which can help other steps indirectly.
