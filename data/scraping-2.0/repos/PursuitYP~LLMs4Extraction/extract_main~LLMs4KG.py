paragraph1 = "Eight distinct facies have been defined in a 110-m thick section of the Lower Devonian Battery Point Sandstone near Gaspe, Quebec. The first is a scoured surface overlain by massive sandstone with mudstone intraclasts. Facies A and B are trough cross-bedded sandstones, with poorly-and well-defined stratification, respectively. Facies C and D consist of large isolated, and smaller multiple, sets of planar cross-stratified sandstones, respectively. Facies E comprises large sandstone-filled scours, facies F comprises ripple cross stratified fine sandstones with interbedded mudstones, and facies G comprises sets of very low angle cross-stratified sandstones. The overall context of the Battery Point Sandstone, the presence of rootlets, and the abundance of trough and planar-tabular cross bedding, all suggest a generally fluvial environment of deposition. Analysis of the facies sequence and interpretation of the primary sedimentary structures suggest that channel development began by scouring, and deposition of an intraclast lag. Above this, the two trough cross bedded facies indicate unidirectional dune migration downchannel (vector mean direction 291). The large planar tabular sets are associated with the trough cross bedded facies, but always show a large (almost 90) paleoflow divergence, suggesting lateral movement of in-channel transverse bars. The smaller planar tabular sets occur higher topographically in the fluvial system, and the rippled silts and muds indicate vertical accretion. Because of the very high ratio of in-channel sandy facies to fine-grained vertical accretion facies, and because of the evidence of lateral migration of large in-channel bars, the Battery Point River appears to resemble modern braided systems more than meandering ones."
paragraph2 = "Patagonia exhibits a particularly abundant record of Cretaceous dinosaurs with worldwide relevance. Although paleontological studies are relatively numerous, few include taphonomic information about these faunas. This contribution provides the first detailed sedimentological and taphonomical analyses of a dinosaur bone quarry from northern Neuquén Basin. At Arroyo Seco (Mendoza Province, Argentina), a large parautochthonous/autochthonous accumulation of articulated and disarticulated bones that represent several sauropod individuals has been discovered. The fossil remains, assigned to Mendozasaurus neguyelap González Riga, correspond to a large (18-27-m long) sauropod titanosaur collected in the strata of the Río Neuquén Subgroup (late Turoronian-late Coniacian). A taphonomic viewpoint recognizes a two-fold division into biostratinomic and fossil-diagenetic processes. Biostratinomic processes include (1) subaerial biodegradation of sauropod carcasses on well-drained floodplains, (2) partial or total skeletal disarticulation, (3) reorientation of bones by sporadic overbank flows, and (4) subaerial weathering. Fossil-diagenetic processes include (1) plastic deformation of bones, (2) initial permineralization with hematite, (3) fracturing and brittle deformation due to lithostatic pressure; (4) secondary permineralization with calcite in vascular canals and fractures, and (5) postfossilization bone weathering. This type of bone concentration, also present in Rincó n de los Sauces (northern Patagonia), suggests that overbank facies tended to accumulate large titanosaur bones. This taphonomic mode, referred to as ''overbank bone assemblages'', outlines the potential of crevasse splay facies as important sources of paleontological data in Cretaceous meandering fluvial systems."
