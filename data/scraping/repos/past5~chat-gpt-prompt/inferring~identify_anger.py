Needed a nice lamp for my bedroom, and this one had \
additional storage and not too high of a price point. \
Got it fast.  The string to our lamp broke during the \
transit and the company happily sent over a new one. \
Came within a few days as well. It was easy to put \
together.  I had a missing part, so I contacted their \
support and they very quickly got me the missing piece! \
Lumina seems to me to be a great company that cares \
about their customers and products!!
