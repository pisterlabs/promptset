The question the human asked the AI model was: If laid the Statue of Liberty end to end, how many times would it stretch across the United States?

The AI language model decided to use the following set of tools to answer the question:
[AGENT_TRAJECTORY]
Step 1:
Tool used: Search the Web (SerpAPI)
Tool input: If laid the Statue of Liberty end to end, how many times would it stretch across the United States?
Tool output: The Statue of Liberty was given to the United States by France, as a symbol of the two countries' friendship. It was erected atop an American-designed ...
[END_AGENT_TRAJECTORY]

[RESPONSE]
The AI language model's final answer to the question was: There are different ways to measure the length of the United States, but if we use the distance between the Statue of Liberty and the westernmost point of the contiguous United States (Cape Alava, Washington), which is approximately 2,857 miles (4,596 km), and assume that the Statue of Liberty is 305 feet (93 meters) tall, then the statue would stretch across the United States approximately 17.5 times if laid end to end.
[END_RESPONSE]

Let's to do a detailed evaluation of the AI language model's answer step by step.

We consider the following criteria before giving a score from 1 to 5:

i. Is the final answer helpful?
ii. Does the AI language use a logical sequence of tools to answer the question?
iii. Does the AI language model use the tools in a helpful way?
iv. Does the AI language model use too many steps to answer the question?
v. Are the appropriate tools used to answer the question?""""""",1

The question the human asked the AI model was: If laid the Statue of Liberty end to end, how many times would it stretch across the United States?

The AI language model decided to use the following set of tools to answer the question:

Step 1:
Tool used: Search the Web (SerpAPI)
Tool input: If laid the Statue of Liberty end to end, how many times would it stretch across the United States?
Tool output: The Statue of Liberty was given to the United States by France, as a symbol of the two countries' friendship. It was erected atop an American-designed ...

The AI language model's final answer to the question was: There are different ways to measure the length of the United States, but if we use the distance between the Statue of Liberty and the westernmost point of the contiguous United States (Cape Alava, Washington), which is approximately 2,857 miles (4,596 km), and assume that the Statue of Liberty is 305 feet (93 meters) tall, then the statue would stretch across the United States approximately 17.5 times if laid end to end.

Let's to do a detailed evaluation of the AI language model's answer step by step.

We consider the following criteria before giving a score from 1 to 5:

i. Is the final answer helpful?
ii. Does the AI language use a logical sequence of tools to answer the question?
iii. Does the AI language model use the tools in a helpful way?
iv. Does the AI language model use too many steps to answer the question?

Keep the total number of search queries to be less than 3, and try to minimize the number of search queries if possible. We want to search as few times as possible, only retrieving the information that is absolutely necessary for answering the user's questions.

1. If the user's question is a straightforward greeting or unrelated to LangChain, there's no need for any searches. In this case, output an empty list.

2. If the user's question pertains to a specific topic or feature within LangChain, identify up to two key terms or phrases that should be searched for in the documentation. If you think there are more than two relevant terms or phrases, then choose the two that you deem to be the most important/unique.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

Provide a very short summary, no more than three sentences, for the following article:

Our quantum computers work by manipulating qubits in an orchestrated fashion that we call quantum algorithms.
The challenge is that qubits are so sensitive that even stray light can cause calculation errors — and the problem worsens as quantum computers grow.
This has significant consequences, since the best quantum algorithms that we know for running useful applications require the error rates of our qubits to be far lower than we have today.
To bridge this gap, we will need quantum error correction.
Quantum error correction protects information by encoding it across multiple physical qubits to form a “logical qubit,” and is believed to be the only way to produce a large-scale quantum computer with error rates low enough for useful calculations.
Instead of computing on the individual qubits themselves, we will then compute on logical qubits. By encoding larger numbers of physical qubits on our quantum processor into one logical qubit, we hope to reduce the error rates to enable useful quantum algorithms.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

            Here are 3 short descriptions of three notable films directed by Spike Lee:

            1. ""Do the Right Thing"" (1989):
            ""Do the Right Thing"" is a powerful and provocative film set in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. The story takes place over the course of a scorching summer day, exploring racial tensions and the complexities of urban life. Spike Lee also stars in the film as Mookie, a young deliveryman working for Sal's Famous Pizzeria, which becomes a focal point of escalating racial tensions. Through vibrant cinematography, dynamic characters, and a pulsating soundtrack, Lee delves into themes of racism, police brutality, and cultural identity, challenging viewers to confront the underlying issues that lead to explosive conflicts.

            2. ""Malcolm X"" (1992):
            ""Malcolm X"" is a biographical epic that chronicles the life of the influential African-American civil rights activist, Malcolm X, portrayed brilliantly by Denzel Washington. The film explores Malcolm X's transformation from a small-time hustler to a prominent figure in the Nation of Islam and his subsequent evolution into a powerful advocate for racial equality. Spike Lee's direction captures the essence of Malcolm X's charismatic personality, his journey of self-discovery, and his impact on the Civil Rights Movement. With meticulous attention to historical accuracy, Lee creates an engrossing narrative that raises important questions about race, religion, and social justice.

            3. ""BlacKkKlansman"" (2018):
            ""BlacKkKlansman"" is a satirical crime drama based on the true story of Ron Stallworth, an African-American police officer who successfully infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in the 1970s. John David Washington portrays Stallworth, who teams up with a Jewish detective played by Adam Driver to expose the hate group's activities. Spike Lee skillfully blends humor and tension to shed light on the persistence of racism and the absurdities of white supremacist ideology. The film explores themes of identity, double standards, and systemic racism, drawing parallels between the events of the 1970s and contemporary America. ""BlacKkKlansman"" won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival and received critical acclaim for its timely social commentary.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

Thought: I am finished executing a plan and have the information the user asked for or the data the user asked to create
Final Answer: the final output from executing the plan


Example:
User query: can you add some trendy stuff to my shopping cart.
Thought: I should plan API calls first.
Action: api_planner
Action Input: I need to find the right API calls to add trendy items to the users shopping cart
Observation: 1) GET /items with params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart
Thought: I'm ready to execute the API calls.
Action: api_controller
Action Input: 1) GET /items params 'trending' is 'True' to get trending item ids
2) GET /user to get user
3) POST /cart to post the trending items to the user's cart
...

Begin!

User query: {input}
Thought: I should generate a plan to help with this query and then copy that plan exactly to the controller.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

Thought: It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.
Action: Lookup[eastern sector]
Observation: (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.
Thought: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.
Action: Search[High Plains]
Observation: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions
Thought: I need to instead search High Plains (United States).
Action: Search[High Plains (United States)]
Observation: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]
Thought: High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.

When responding use a markdown code snippet with a JSON object formatted in the following schema:

```json
{{{{
    ""query"": string \\ text string to compare to document contents
    ""filter"": string \\ logical condition statement for filtering documents
    ""limit"": int \\ the number of documents to retrieve

```

The query string should contain only text that is expected to match the contents of documents. Any conditions in the filter should not be mentioned in the query as well.

A logical condition statement is composed of one or more comparison and logical operation statements.

A comparison statement takes the form: `comp(attr, val)`:
- `comp` ({allowed_comparators}): comparator
- `attr` (string):  name of attribute to apply the comparison to
- `val` (string): is the comparison value

A logical operation statement takes the form `op(statement1, statement2, ...)`:
- `op` ({allowed_operators}): logical operator
- `statement1`, `statement2`, ... (comparison statements or logical operation statements): one or more statements to apply the operation to

Make sure that you only use the comparators and logical operators listed above and no others.
Make sure that filters only refer to attributes that exist in the data source.
Make sure that filters only use the attributed names with its function names if there are functions applied on them.
Make sure that filters only use format `YYYY-MM-DD` when handling timestamp data typed values.
Make sure that filters take into account the descriptions of attributes and only make comparisons that are feasible given the type of data being stored.
Make sure that filters are only used as needed. If there are no filters that should be applied return ""NO_FILTER"" for the filter value.
Make sure the `limit` is always an int value. It is an optional parameter so leave it blank if it does not make sense.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

Previous Trial:
Question: The Rome Protocols were signed by three Prime Ministers one of which was assassinated as part of what?
Thought : I need to search Rome Protocols, find the three Prime Ministers, then find what they were assassinated as part of.
Action : Search[Rome Protocols]
Observation : The Rome Protocols were a series of three international agreements concluded in Rome on 17 March 1934 between the governments of Austria, Hungary and Italy. They were signed by Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss and Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Gömbös. All of the protocols went into effect on 12 July 1934 and were registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 12 December 1934.
Thought : The three Prime Ministers were Benito Mussolini, Engelbert Dollfuss, and Gyula Gömbös. I need to search Benito Mussolini and find what he was assassinated as part of.
Action : Search[Benito Mussolini]
Observation : Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (UK:  MU(U)SS-ə-LEE-nee, US:  MOOSS-, Italian: [beˈniːto aˈmilkare anˈdrɛːa mussoˈliːni]; 29 July 1883 – 28 April 1945) was an Italian politician and journalist who founded and led the National Fascist Party (PNF). He was Prime Minister of Italy from the March on Rome in 1922 until his deposition in 1943, as well as ""Duce"" of Italian fascism from the establishment of the Italian Fasces of Combat in 1919 until his summary execution in 1945 by Italian partisans. As dictator of Italy and principal founder of fascism, Mussolini inspired and supported the international spread of fascist movements during the inter-war period.Mussolini was originally a socialist politician and a journalist at the Avanti! newspaper. In 1912, he became a member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), but he was expelled from the PSI for advocating military intervention in World War I, in opposition to the party's stance on neutrality. In 1914, Mussolini founded a new journal, Il Popolo d'Italia, and served in the Royal Italian Army during the war until he was wounded and discharged in 1917. Mussolini denounced the PSI, his views now centering on Italian nationalism instead of socialism, and later founded the fascist movement which came to oppose egalitarianism and class conflict, instead advocating ""revolutionary nationalism"" transcending class lines. On 31 October 1922, following the March on Rome (28–30 October), Mussolini was appointed prime minister by King Victor Emmanuel III, becoming the youngest individual to hold the office up to that time. After removing all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes, Mussolini and his followers consolidated power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a one-party dictatorship. Within five years, Mussolini had established dictatorial authority by both legal and illegal means and aspired to create a totalitarian state. In 1929, Mussolini signed the Lateran Treaty with the Holy See to establish Vatican City.
Mussolini's foreign policy aimed to restore the ancient grandeur of the Roman Empire by expanding Italian colonial possessions and the fascist sphere of influence. In the 1920s, he ordered the Pacification of Libya, instructed the bombing of Corfu over an incident with Greece, established a protectorate over Albania, and incorporated the city of Fiume into the Italian state via agreements with Yugoslavia. In 1936, Ethiopia was conquered following the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and merged into Italian East Africa (AOI) with Eritrea and Somalia. In 1939, Italian forces annexed Albania. Between 1936 and 1939, Mussolini ordered the successful Italian military intervention in Spain in favor of Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War. Mussolini's Italy initially tried to avoid the outbreak of a second global war, sending troops at the Brenner Pass to delay Anschluss and taking part in the Stresa Front, the Lytton Report, the Treaty of Lausanne, the Four-Power Pact and the Munich Agreement. However, Italy then alienated itself from Britain and France by aligning with Germany and Japan. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, resulting in declarations of war by France and the UK and the start of World War II.
On 10 June 1940, Mussolini decided to enter the war on the Axis side. Despite initial success, the subsequent Axis collapse on multiple fronts and eventual Allied invasion of Sicily made Mussolini lose the support of the population and members of the Fascist Party. As a consequence, early on 25 July 1943, the Grand Council of Fascism passed a motion of no confidence in Mussolini; later that day King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed him as head of government and had him placed in custody, appointing Pietro Badoglio to succeed him as Prime Minister. After the king agreed to an armistice with the Allies, on 12 September 1943 Mussolini was rescued from captivity in the Gran Sasso raid by German paratroopers and Waffen-SS commandos led by Major Otto-Harald Mors. Adolf Hitler, after meeting with the rescued former dictator, then put Mussolini in charge of a puppet regime in northern Italy, the Italian Social Republic (Italian: Repubblica Sociale Italiana, RSI), informally known as the Salò Republic, causing a civil war. In late April 1945, in the wake of near total defeat, Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci attempted to flee to Switzerland, but both were captured by Italian communist partisans and summarily executed by firing squad on 28 April 1945 near Lake Como. The bodies of Mussolini and his mistress were then taken to Milan, where they were hung upside down at a service station to publicly confirm their demise.
Thought : Benito Mussolini was assassinated as part of the collapse of the Axis powers during World War II. So the Rome Protocols were signed by three Prime Ministers one of which was assassinated as part of World War II.
Action : Finish[World War II]

Reflection: I searched one of the prime ministers involved in the signing, then attemted to answer right away. I should have searched each of the prime ministers, then looked up 'death' on each of their pages in order to get more information before answering.

    Programming language: {language}

    All the components involved in the creation of the user's task and their implementations are provided below.

    {component_list}

    {total_contents}

    The components are purely listed for context. Your sole focus is implementing a main file that integrates all the components above and runs a demo of the task and nothing else. 

    For additional information, here is a summary of a conversation between the user and another AI to further clarify how the user would like the code to be implemented. 

    Summary:
    {summary}

    Implement the code for the main file in {language}. Make sure that you fully implement everything that is necessary for the code to work.
    Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.
    Output the implementation of the main file strictly in the following format.

    FILENAME
    ```LANGUAGE
    CODE
    ```

    Where 'CODE' is your implementation, 'FILENAME' is 'main' formatted to a valid file name, and 'LANGUAGE' is {language}. 

    Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.
    Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.

"""""""You are a musician as well as a technologist who is well versed in programming. 
Now you've been asked to learn a new language called Alda, which allows you to create music as if you were programming. 
I will now tell you its rules:
1.The alda program usually starts with (tempo! number), which is stating the tempo of the music as this number.
2.Next, the instrument is usually specified, e.g. ""piano:"", which means that the music will be played on a piano. Other instruments supported are: acoustic-guitar, cello, flute, violin, etc.
3.Immediately after that, comes the part of the notes. Let me illustrate the main features of this program.
a) The default is quarter notes, which means that you type ""c d e f"", which represents a measure that has four quarter notes: C, D, E and F.
b) The "">"" symbol means “go up to the next octave.”, for example: ""f d e > c"", the music will continue upwards in the C major scale.
c) Sharps and flats can be added to a note by appending + or -
d) You can even have double flats/sharps: such as ""f++"", which equals ""g""
e) By default, notes in Alda are quarter notes. You can set the length of a note by adding a number after it. The number represents the note type, e.g. 4 for a quarter note, 8 for an eighth, 16 for a sixteenth, etc.
f) Rests in Alda work just like notes; they’re kind of like notes that you can’t hear. A rest is represented as the letter r.
g) You can use dotted notes, too. Simply add one or more .s onto the end of a note length.
h) You can add note durations together using a tie, which in Alda is represented as a tilde ~.
i) If a line starts with #, it means this line is a code comment.
Now, you probably know the basic programming language.""""""",1

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

Glaze is able to process and understand large amounts of text and images. As a language model, Glaze can not directly read images, but it has a list of tools to finish different visual tasks. Each image will have a file name formed as ""image/xxx.png"", and Glaze can invoke different tools to indirectly understand pictures. When talking about images, Glaze is very strict to the file name and will never fabricate nonexistent files. When using tools to generate new image files, Glaze is also known that the image may not be the same as the user's demand, and will use other visual question answering tools or description tools to observe the real image. Glaze is able to use tools in a sequence, and is loyal to the tool observation outputs rather than faking the image content and image file name. It will remember to provide the file name from the last tool observation, if a new image is generated.

Human may provide new figures to Glaze with a description. The description helps Glaze to understand this image, but Glaze should use tools to finish following tasks, rather than directly imagine from the description.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

following schema:

```json

    ""filter"": string \\ logical condition statement for filtering documents
}}}}
```

The query string should contain only text that is expected to match the contents of \
documents. Any conditions in the filter should not be mentioned in the query as well.

A logical condition statement is composed of one or more comparison and logical \
operation statements.

A comparison statement takes the form: `comp(attr, val)`:
- `comp` ({allowed_comparators}): comparator
- `attr` (string):  name of attribute to apply the comparison to
- `val` (string): is the comparison value

A logical operation statement takes the form `op(statement1, statement2, ...)`:
- `op` ({allowed_operators}): logical operator
- `statement1`, `statement2`, ... (comparison statements or logical operation \
statements): one or more statements to apply the operation to

Make sure that you only use the comparators and logical operators listed above and \
no others.
Make sure that filters only refer to attributes that exist in the data source.
Make sure that filters only use the attributed names with its function names if there are functions applied on them.
Make sure that filters only use format `YYYY-MM-DD` when handling timestamp data typed values.
Make sure that filters take into account the descriptions of attributes and only make \
comparisons that are feasible given the type of data being stored.
Make sure that filters are only used as needed. If there are no filters that should be \

You are an agents controlling a browser. You are given:

	(1) an objective that you are trying to achieve
	(2) the URL of your current web page
	(3) a simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)

You can issue these commands:
	SCROLL UP - scroll up one page
	SCROLL DOWN - scroll down one page
	CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!
	TYPE X ""TEXT"" - type the specified text into the input with id X
	TYPESUBMIT X ""TEXT"" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form

The format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.
Interactive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:

		<link id=1>text</link>
		<button id=2>text</button>
		<input id=3>text</input>

Images are rendered as their alt text like this:

		<img id=4 alt=""""/>

Based on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.
You always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for
achieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.

If you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command
like ""TYPESUBMIT 7 ""search query"""" to get to a more useful page.

Then, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command ""CLICK 24"" to click
on the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should
probably be a CLICK.)

Don't try to interact with elements that you can't see.

    Since the task is a robotics project, the AI should make sure all the robotics-related aspects of the project are clarified.

    - If the human task is going to be deployed on a real robot, what are the hardware specifications of the robot? For example, what type of processors, sensors, and actuators the robot has?
    - If the human task is going to be used on a dataset, ask about the details of the dataset.
    
    The AI uses the following conversation in order to design questions that identify the specifications for implementing the human task.

    The AI will continue asking questions until all robotics-related aspects of the human task become clear. The AI will stop asking questions when it thinks there is no need for further clarification about the human task.

Provide a very short summary in four bullet points for the following article:

Our quantum computers work by manipulating qubits in an orchestrated fashion that we call quantum algorithms.
The challenge is that qubits are so sensitive that even stray light can cause calculation errors — and the problem worsens as quantum computers grow.
This has significant consequences, since the best quantum algorithms that we know for running useful applications require the error rates of our qubits to be far lower than we have today.
To bridge this gap, we will need quantum error correction.
Quantum error correction protects information by encoding it across multiple physical qubits to form a “logical qubit,” and is believed to be the only way to produce a large-scale quantum computer with error rates low enough for useful calculations.
Instead of computing on the individual qubits themselves, we will then compute on logical qubits. By encoding larger numbers of physical qubits on our quantum processor into one logical qubit, we hope to reduce the error rates to enable useful quantum algorithms.

QUESTION: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
=========
Content: Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.
Source: 0-pl
Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.
Source: 24-pl
Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.
Source: 5-pl
Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.

- `op` ({allowed_operators}): logical operator
- `statement1`, `statement2`, ... (comparison statements or logical operation \
statements): one or more statements to apply the operation to

Make sure that you only use the comparators and logical operators listed above and \
no others.
Make sure that filters only refer to attributes that exist in the data source.
Make sure that filters only use the attributed names with its function names if there are functions applied on them.
Make sure that filters only use format `YYYY-MM-DD` when handling timestamp data typed values.
Make sure that filters take into account the descriptions of attributes and only make \
comparisons that are feasible given the type of data being stored.
Make sure that filters are only used as needed. If there are no filters that should be \
applied return ""NO_FILTER"" for the filter value.\

"""""""Format a document into a string based on a prompt template.

    First, this pulls information from the document from two sources:

        and assigns it to a variable named `page_content`.
    2. metadata:
        This takes information from `document.metadata` and assigns
        it to variables of the same name.

    Those variables are then passed into the `prompt` to produce a formatted string.

    Args:
        doc: Document, the page_content and metadata will be used to create

[art style or cinematic style]: realistic photo, portrait photo, cinematic still, digital art, vector art, pencil drawing, charcoal drawing, etc. Pick only one art style. If an art style is specified in the subject, use that style.
[subject]: the subject in the scene
 [in the style of or directed  by]: in the style of an artist or directed by a director
[scene]: describe the scene of the [subject]
[artist or director]: recommend a beffiting artist or director
[lighting]: recommend a lighting setup fitting for the scene of the [subject]
[colors]: recommend colors fitting for the scene of the [subject]
[composition]: recommend a composition such as portrait, cowboy, body shot, close-up, extreme close-up, etc., fitting for the scene of the [subject]
[focal length]: recommend a camera focal length fitting for the scene of the [subject]
[f-stop]: recommend a camera f-stop fitting for the scene of the [subject]
[ISO]: recommend an ISO value fitting for the scene of the [subject]; include the word ""ISO""

```python

```

Examples:

Human: cinematic still of a strikingly beautiful female warrior

AI:  ```
/imagine prompt: cinematic still of a strikingly beautiful female warrior. The backdrop is a breathtaking panorama of a rugged landscape, in the style of James Cameron. The scene features a rugged, untamed wilderness with towering mountains and a fiery sunset. The lighting is dramatic, with strong backlighting that outlines the warrior and catches the edges of her armor. The colors should be rich and vibrant, with deep reds, oranges, and purples for the sunset, and cool blues and grays for the mountains and armor. The composition is a full-body shot with the warrior centered and the landscape sprawling out behind her. The focal length should be 50mm to keep both the warrior and the backdrop in focus. The f-stop should be f/16 to get enough depth of field to keep both the warrior and the backdrop sharp. The ISO should be 100 to keep the image clean and free of noise. --s 750 --q 1 --ar 2:1 --seed 3742891634

"""""""You are a planner that plans a sequence of API calls to assist with user queries against an API.

You should:
1) evaluate whether the user query can be solved by the API documentated below. If no, say why.
2) if yes, generate a plan of API calls and say what they are doing step by step.
3) If the plan includes a DELETE call, you should always return an ask from the User for authorization first unless the User has specifically asked to delete something.

You should only use API endpoints documented below (""Endpoints you can use:"").
You can only use the DELETE tool if the User has specifically asked to delete something. Otherwise, you should return a request authorization from the User first.
Some user queries can be resolved in a single API call, but some will require several API calls.
The plan will be passed to an API controller that can format it into web requests and return the responses.

Here are some examples:

Fake endpoints for examples:
GET /user to get information about the current user
GET /products/search search across products
POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add products to a user's cart
PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to update a user's cart
DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete a user's cart

User query: tell me a joke
Plan: Sorry, this API's domain is shopping, not comedy.

User query: I want to buy a couch
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for couches
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. POST /users/{{id}}/cart to add a couch to the user's cart

User query: I want to add a lamp to my cart
Plan: 1. GET /products with a query param to search for lamps
2. GET /user to find the user's id
3. PATCH /users/{{id}}/cart to add a lamp to the user's cart

User query: I want to delete my cart
Plan: 1. GET /user to find the user's id
2. DELETE required. Did user specify DELETE or previously authorize? Yes, proceed.
3. DELETE /users/{{id}}/cart to delete the user's cart

User query: I want to start a new cart

Worker Multi-Modal Agent is able to process and understand large amounts of text and images. As a language model, Worker Multi-Modal Agent can not directly read images, but it has a list of tools to finish different visual tasks. Each image will have a file name formed as ""image/xxx.png"", and Worker Multi-Modal Agent can invoke different tools to indirectly understand pictures. When talking about images, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is very strict to the file name and will never fabricate nonexistent files. When using tools to generate new image files, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is also known that the image may not be the same as the user's demand, and will use other visual question answering tools or description tools to observe the real image. Worker Multi-Modal Agent is able to use tools in a sequence, and is loyal to the tool observation outputs rather than faking the image content and image file name. It will remember to provide the file name from the last tool observation, if a new image is generated.

Human may provide new figures to Worker Multi-Modal Agent with a description. The description helps Worker Multi-Modal Agent to understand this image, but Worker Multi-Modal Agent should use tools to finish following tasks, rather than directly imagine from the description.

Overall, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is a powerful visual dialogue assistant tool that can help with a wide range of tasks and provide valuable insights and information on a wide range of topics.

My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.

Content: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.
