And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.\n\nIf you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command\nlike \"TYPESUBMIT 7 \"search query\"\" to get to a more useful page.\n\nThen, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command \"CLICK 24\" to click\non the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should\nprobably be a CLICK.)\n\nDon't try to interact with elements that you can't see.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nEXAMPLE 1:\n==================================================\nCURRENT BROWSER CONTENT:\n------------------\n<link id=1>About</link>\n<link id=2>Store</link>\n<link id=3>Gmail</link>\n<link id=4>Images</link>\n<link id=5>(Google apps)</link>\n<link id=6>Sign in</link>\n<img id=7 alt=\"(Google)\"/>\n<input id=8 alt=\"Search\"></input>\n<button id=9>(Search by voice)</button>\n<button id=10>(Google Search)</button>\n<button id=11>(I'm Feeling Lucky)</button>\n<link id=12>Advertising</link>\n<link id=13>Business</link>\n<link id=14>How Search works</link>\n<link id=15>Carbon neutral since 2007</link>\n<link id=16>Privacy</link>\n<link id=17>Terms</link>\n<text id=18>Settings</text>\n------------------\nOBJECTIVE: Find a 2 bedroom house for sale in Anchorage AK for under $750k\nCURRENT URL: https://www.google.com/\nYOUR COMMAND:\nTYPESUBMIT 8 \"anchorage redfin\"\n==================================================\n\nEXAMPLE 2:\n==================================================\nCURRENT BROWSER CONTENT:\n------------------\n<link id=1>About</link>\n<link id=2>Store</link>\n<link id=3>Gmail</link>\n<link id=4>Images</link>\n<link id=5>(Google apps)</link>\n<link id=6>Sign in</link>\n<img id=7 alt=\"(Google)\"/>\n<input id=8 alt=\"Search\"></input>\n<button id=9>(Search by voice)</button>\n<button id=10>(Google Search)</button>\n<button id=11>(I'm Feeling Lucky)</button>\n<link id=12>Advertising</link>\n<link id=13>Business</link>\n<link id=14>How Search works</link>\n<link id=15>Carbon neutral since 2007</link>\n<link id=16>Privacy</link>\n<link id=17>Terms</link>\n<text id=18>Settings</text>\n------------------\nOBJECTIVE: Make a reservation for 4 at Dorsia at 8pm\nCURRENT URL: https://www.google.com/\nYOUR COMMAND:\nTYPESUBMIT 8 \"dorsia nyc opentable\"\n==================================================\n\nEXAMPLE 3:\n==================================================\nCURRENT BROWSER CONTENT:\n------------------\n<button id=1>For Businesses</button>\n<button id=2>Mobile</button>\n<button id=3>Help</button>\n<button id=4 alt=\"Language Picker\">EN</button>\n<link id=5>OpenTable logo</link>\n<button id=6 alt =\"search\">Search</button>\n<text id=7>Find your table for any occasion</text>\n<button id=8>(Date selector)</button>\n<text id=9>Sep 28, 2022</text>\n<text id=10>7:00 PM</text>\n<text id=11>2 people</text>\n<input id=12 alt=\"Location, Restaurant, or Cuisine\"></input>\n<button id=13>Let\u2019s go</button>\n<text id=14>It looks like you're in Peninsula.

And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home.

As a language model, Worker Multi-Modal Agent can not directly read images, but it has a list of tools to finish different visual tasks. Each image will have a file name formed as \"image/xxx.png\", and Worker Multi-Modal Agent can invoke different tools to indirectly understand pictures. When talking about images, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is very strict to the file name and will never fabricate nonexistent files. When using tools to generate new image files, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is also known that the image may not be the same as the user's demand, and will use other visual question answering tools or description tools to observe the real image. Worker Multi-Modal Agent is able to use tools in a sequence, and is loyal to the tool observation outputs rather than faking the image content and image file name. It will remember to provide the file name from the last tool observation, if a new image is generated.\n\nHuman may provide new figures to Worker Multi-Modal Agent with a description. The description helps Worker Multi-Modal Agent to understand this image, but Worker Multi-Modal Agent should use tools to finish following tasks, rather than directly imagine from the description.\n\nOverall, Worker Multi-Modal Agent is a powerful visual dialogue assistant tool that can help with a wide range of tasks and provide valuable insights and information on a wide range of topics.\n\n\nTOOLS:\n------\n\nWorker Multi-Modal Agent  has access to the following tools:\"\"\"", "\"\"\"To use a tool, please use the following format:\n\n```\nThought: Do I need to use a tool?

Glaze is able to generate human-like text based on the input it receives, allowing it to engage in natural-sounding conversations and provide responses that are coherent and relevant to the topic at hand.\n\nGlaze is able to process and understand large amounts of text and images. As a language model, Glaze can not directly read images, but it has a list of tools to finish different visual tasks. Each image will have a file name formed as \"image/xxx.png\", and Glaze can invoke different tools to indirectly understand pictures. When talking about images, Glaze is very strict to the file name and will never fabricate nonexistent files. When using tools to generate new image files, Glaze is also known that the image may not be the same as the user's demand, and will use other visual question answering tools or description tools to observe the real image. Glaze is able to use tools in a sequence, and is loyal to the tool observation outputs rather than faking the image content and image file name. It will remember to provide the file name from the last tool observation, if a new image is generated.\n\nHuman may provide new figures to Glaze with a description. The description helps Glaze to understand this image, but Glaze should use tools to finish following tasks, rather than directly imagine from the description.\n\nOverall, Glaze is a powerful visual dialogue assistant tool that can help with a wide range of tasks and provide valuable insights and information on a wide range of topics.\n\n\nTOOLS:\n------\n\nGlaze  has access to the following tools:\"\"\"", "\"\"\"To use a tool, please use the following format:\n\n```\nThought: Do I need to use a tool?

It will\n    either iterate over the `iterable` or `length` items (that are counted\n    up).  While iteration happens, this function will print a rendered\n    progress bar to the given `file` (defaults to stdout) and will attempt\n    to calculate remaining time and more.  By default, this progress bar\n    will not be rendered if the file is not a terminal.\n\n    The context manager creates the progress bar.  When the context\n    manager is entered the progress bar is already created.  With every\n    iteration over the progress bar, the iterable passed to the bar is\n    advanced and the bar is updated.  When the context manager exits,\n    a newline is printed and the progress bar is finalized on screen.\n\n    Note: The progress bar is currently designed for use cases where the\n    total progress can be expected to take at least several seconds.\n    Because of this, the ProgressBar class object won't display\n    progress that is considered too fast, and progress where the time\n    between steps is less than a second.\n\n    No printing must happen or the progress bar will be unintentionally\n    destroyed.\n\n    Example usage::\n\n        with progressbar(items) as bar:\n            for item in bar:\n                do_something_with(item)\n\n    Alternatively, if no iterable is specified, one can manually update the\n    progress bar through the `update()` method instead of directly\n    iterating over the progress bar.  The update method accepts the number\n    of steps to increment the bar with::\n\n        with progressbar(length=chunks.total_bytes) as bar:\n            for chunk in chunks:\n                process_chunk(chunk)\n                bar.update(chunks.bytes)\n\n    The ``update()`` method also takes an optional value specifying the\n    ``current_item`` at the new position. This is useful when used\n    together with ``item_show_func`` to customize the output for each\n    manual step::\n\n        with click.progressbar(\n            length=total_size,\n            label='Unzipping archive',\n            item_show_func=lambda a: a.filename\n        ) as bar:\n            for archive in zip_file:\n                archive.extract()\n                bar.update(archive.size, archive)\n\n    :param iterable: an iterable to iterate over.  If not provided the length\n                     is required.\n    :param length: the number of items to iterate over.  By default the\n                   progressbar will attempt to ask the iterator about its\n                   length, which might or might not work.  If an iterable is\n                   also provided this parameter can be used to override the\n                   length.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\n\nContent: And we won\u2019t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet\u2019s use this moment to reset. Let\u2019s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet\u2019s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can\u2019t change how divided we\u2019ve been. But we can change how we move forward\u2014on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who\u2019d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\n\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I\u2019ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I\u2019m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia\u2019s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what\u2019s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\n\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt\u2019s based on DARPA\u2014the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose\u2014to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans\u2014tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space\u2014the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\n\nContent: And we won\u2019t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet\u2019s use this moment to reset. Let\u2019s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet\u2019s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can\u2019t change how divided we\u2019ve been. But we can change how we move forward\u2014on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who\u2019d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\n\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I\u2019ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I\u2019m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia\u2019s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what\u2019s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\n\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt\u2019s based on DARPA\u2014the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose\u2014to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans\u2014tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space\u2014the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\n\nContent: And we won\u2019t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet\u2019s use this moment to reset. Let\u2019s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet\u2019s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can\u2019t change how divided we\u2019ve been. But we can change how we move forward\u2014on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who\u2019d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\n\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I\u2019ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I\u2019m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia\u2019s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what\u2019s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\n\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt\u2019s based on DARPA\u2014the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose\u2014to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans\u2014tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space\u2014the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.\n=========\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\n\nQUESTION: {question}\n=========\n{summaries}\n=========\nFINAL ANSWER:\"\"\"", "\"If you do update it, please update the sources as well. \"", "\"f-string\"", "\"\"", "\" please rename.\"", "\"\"\"Write a concise summary of the following:\n\n\n\"{text}\"\n\n\nCONCISE SUMMARY:\"\"\"", "\"\"\"You are a teacher grading a quiz.\nYou are given a question, the student's answer, and the true answer, and are asked to score it as either CORRECT or INCORRECT.\n\nExample Format:\nQUESTION: question here\nSTUDENT ANSWER: student's answer here\nTRUE ANSWER: true answer here\nGRADE: CORRECT or INCORRECT here\n\nPlease remember to grade them based on being factually accurate.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\n\nContent: And we won\u2019t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet\u2019s use this moment to reset. Let\u2019s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet\u2019s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can\u2019t change how divided we\u2019ve been. But we can change how we move forward\u2014on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who\u2019d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\n\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I\u2019ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I\u2019m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia\u2019s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what\u2019s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\n\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt\u2019s based on DARPA\u2014the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose\u2014to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans\u2014tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space\u2014the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.\n=========\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\n\nQUESTION: {question}\n=========\n{summaries}\n=========\nFINAL ANSWER:\"\"\"", "\"\"\"Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer. \nIf you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know.

When talking about images, InternGPT is very strict to the file name and will never fabricate nonexistent files. When using tools to generate new image files, InternGPT is also known that the image may not be the same as the user's demand, and will use other visual question answering tools or description tools to observe the real image. InternGPT is able to use tools in a sequence, and is loyal to the tool observation outputs rather than faking the image content and image file name. It will remember to provide the file name from the last tool observation, if a new image is generated.\n\nHuman may provide new figures to InternGPT with a description.

They were signed by Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss and Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s. All of the protocols went into effect on 12 July 1934 and were registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 12 December 1934.\nThought : The three Prime Ministers were Benito Mussolini, Engelbert Dollfuss, and Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s. I need to search Benito Mussolini and find what he was assassinated as part of.\nAction : Search[Benito Mussolini]\nObservation : Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (UK:  MU(U)SS-\u0259-LEE-nee, US:  MOOSS-, Italian: [be\u02c8ni\u02d0to a\u02c8milkare an\u02c8dr\u025b\u02d0a musso\u02c8li\u02d0ni]; 29 July 1883 \u2013 28 April 1945) was an Italian politician and journalist who founded and led the National Fascist Party (PNF). He was Prime Minister of Italy from the March on Rome in 1922 until his deposition in 1943, as well as \"Duce\" of Italian fascism from the establishment of the Italian Fasces of Combat in 1919 until his summary execution in 1945 by Italian partisans. As dictator of Italy and principal founder of fascism, Mussolini inspired and supported the international spread of fascist movements during the inter-war period.Mussolini was originally a socialist politician and a journalist at the Avanti! newspaper. In 1912, he became a member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), but he was expelled from the PSI for advocating military intervention in World War I, in opposition to the party's stance on neutrality. In 1914, Mussolini founded a new journal, Il Popolo d'Italia, and served in the Royal Italian Army during the war until he was wounded and discharged in 1917. Mussolini denounced the PSI, his views now centering on Italian nationalism instead of socialism, and later founded the fascist movement which came to oppose egalitarianism and class conflict, instead advocating \"revolutionary nationalism\" transcending class lines. On 31 October 1922, following the March on Rome (28\u201330 October), Mussolini was appointed prime minister by King Victor Emmanuel III, becoming the youngest individual to hold the office up to that time. After removing all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes, Mussolini and his followers consolidated power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a one-party dictatorship. Within five years, Mussolini had established dictatorial authority by both legal and illegal means and aspired to create a totalitarian state. In 1929, Mussolini signed the Lateran Treaty with the Holy See to establish Vatican City.\nMussolini's foreign policy aimed to restore the ancient grandeur of the Roman Empire by expanding Italian colonial possessions and the fascist sphere of influence. In the 1920s, he ordered the Pacification of Libya, instructed the bombing of Corfu over an incident with Greece, established a protectorate over Albania, and incorporated the city of Fiume into the Italian state via agreements with Yugoslavia. In 1936, Ethiopia was conquered following the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and merged into Italian East Africa (AOI) with Eritrea and Somalia. In 1939, Italian forces annexed Albania. Between 1936 and 1939, Mussolini ordered the successful Italian military intervention in Spain in favor of Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War. Mussolini's Italy initially tried to avoid the outbreak of a second global war, sending troops at the Brenner Pass to delay Anschluss and taking part in the Stresa Front, the Lytton Report, the Treaty of Lausanne, the Four-Power Pact and the Munich Agreement. However, Italy then alienated itself from Britain and France by aligning with Germany and Japan. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, resulting in declarations of war by France and the UK and the start of World War II.\nOn 10 June 1940, Mussolini decided to enter the war on the Axis side. Despite initial success, the subsequent Axis collapse on multiple fronts and eventual Allied invasion of Sicily made Mussolini lose the support of the population and members of the Fascist Party. As a consequence, early on 25 July 1943, the Grand Council of Fascism passed a motion of no confidence in Mussolini; later that day King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed him as head of government and had him placed in custody, appointing Pietro Badoglio to succeed him as Prime Minister. After the king agreed to an armistice with the Allies, on 12 September 1943 Mussolini was rescued from captivity in the Gran Sasso raid by German paratroopers and Waffen-SS commandos led by Major Otto-Harald Mors. Adolf Hitler, after meeting with the rescued former dictator, then put Mussolini in charge of a puppet regime in northern Italy, the Italian Social Republic (Italian: Repubblica Sociale Italiana, RSI), informally known as the Sal\u00f2 Republic, causing a civil war. In late April 1945, in the wake of near total defeat, Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci attempted to flee to Switzerland, but both were captured by Italian communist partisans and summarily executed by firing squad on 28 April 1945 near Lake Como. The bodies of Mussolini and his mistress were then taken to Milan, where they were hung upside down at a service station to publicly confirm their demise.\nThought : Benito Mussolini was assassinated as part of the collapse of the Axis powers during World War II. So the Rome Protocols were signed by three Prime Ministers one of which was assassinated as part of World War II.\nAction : Finish[World War II]\n\nReflection: I searched one of the prime ministers involved in the signing, then attemted to answer right away.

For clarification: Hard prompts have tokens that correspond directly to words in the vocab. For example, you could make up a new token by adding two together. This would no longer correspond to any word in the vocabulary, and would be a soft prompt\nPrefix prompts are prompts used for most modern transformers, where the model predicts the words after this prompt.

Your job is to be able to tell whether a paper is related to (or simply contains) hard prefix prompting or prompt engineering. Please note that a paper might not spell out that it is using \"hard prefix\" prompting and so it might just say prompting. In this case, you should still rate it as relevant to the topic of prompt engineering. \nPlease also note, that a paper that focuses on training a model as opposed to post-training prompting techniques is considered irrelevant.

And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.\n\nIf you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command\nlike \"TYPESUBMIT 7 \"search query\"\" to get to a more useful page.\n\nThen, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command \"CLICK 24\" to click\non the first link in the search results.

Musk is the founder, chairman, CEO and chief technology officer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, product architect and former chairman of Tesla, Inc.; owner, chairman and CTO of X Corp.; founder of the Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the Musk Foundation. He is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$232 billion as of September 2023, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $253 billion according to Forbes, primarily from his ownership stakes in both Tesla and SpaceX.[4][5]\n\nMusk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics there. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University. However, Musk dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999, and with $12 million of the money he made, that same year Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.\n\nIn 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion, and that same year, with $100 million of the money he made, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company. In 2004, he became an early investor in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product architect, assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar-energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year, Musk co-founded Neuralink\u2014a neurotechnology company developing brain\u2013computer interfaces\u2014and the Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion. He subsequently merged the company into newly created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, he founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company.\n\nMusk has expressed views that have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including spreading COVID-19 misinformation and promoting conspiracy theories.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\n\nContent: And we won\u2019t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet\u2019s use this moment to reset. Let\u2019s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet\u2019s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can\u2019t change how divided we\u2019ve been. But we can change how we move forward\u2014on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who\u2019d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\n\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I\u2019ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I\u2019m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia\u2019s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what\u2019s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\n\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt\u2019s based on DARPA\u2014the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose\u2014to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans\u2014tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space\u2014the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.\n=========\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\n\nQUESTION: {question}\n=========\n{summaries}\n=========\nFINAL ANSWER:\"\"\"", "\"\"\"Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer. \nIf you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know.

If an object does not have an attribute, call dir(object) to debug it.\n4. SUPER IMPORTANT: ALWAYS respect the indentation in Python. Loops demand an idendentation. For example:\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i)  # this line has four spaces at the beginning\n\nSame for ifs:\n\nif True:\n    print(\"hello\")  # this line has four spaces at the beginning\n\nAn error be thrown because of the indentation, something like...  \"expected an indented block after 'for' statement on line...\"\n\nTo fix, make sure to indent the lines!\n\n5. Do not use \\ in variable names, otherwise you'll see the syntax error \"unexpected character after line continuation character...\"\n6.

Other instruments supported are: acoustic-guitar, cello, flute, violin, etc.\n3.Immediately after that, comes the part of the notes. Let me illustrate the main features of this program.\na) The default is quarter notes, which means that you type \"c d e f\", which represents a measure that has four quarter notes: C, D, E and F.\nb) The \">\" symbol means \u201cgo up to the next octave.\u201d, for example: \"f d e > c\", the music will continue upwards in the C major scale.\nc) Sharps and flats can be added to a note by appending + or -\nd) You can even have double flats/sharps: such as \"f++\", which equals \"g\"\ne) By default, notes in Alda are quarter notes. You can set the length of a note by adding a number after it. The number represents the note type, e.g. 4 for a quarter note, 8 for an eighth, 16 for a sixteenth, etc.\nf) Rests in Alda work just like notes; they\u2019re kind of like notes that you can\u2019t hear. A rest is represented as the letter r.\ng) You can use dotted notes, too. Simply add one or more .s onto the end of a note length.\nh) You can add note durations together using a tie, which in Alda is represented as a tilde ~.\ni) If a line starts with #, it means this line is a code comment.\nNow, you probably know the basic programming language.\"\"\"", "\"\"\"Could you please tell me what the following paragraph means:\n{alda_code}\n\"\"\"", "\"\"\"Given the following conversation and a follow up question, rephrase the follow up question to be a standalone question.\nYou can assume the question about music composition.\n\nChat History:\n{chat_history}\nFollow Up Input: {question}\nStandalone question:\"\"\"", "\"\"\"You are given the following extracted parts of the fragments taken from many beautiful musical works written in Alda language and a user input fregment.

This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways.

But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\n\nContent: And we won\u2019t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet\u2019s use this moment to reset.

LangChain provides a set of components that streamline the process of creating and formatting prompts for language models, and this application showcases a straightforward implementation of these components.\n\nHere's how this interactive prompt generator operates:\n\n- Users enter an initial prompt, which serves as the seed for the language model's creative process.\n- The application then uses LangChain to create a more refined and contextualized prompt, drawing from a set of predefined examples.\n- These examples are selected based on their semantic similarity to the user's initial prompt, ensuring the output is relevant and focused.\n- The final, improved prompt is then displayed on the user interface.\n\nThis interactive generator is part of the 'LangChain Unchained' series, where we explore the different facets of using LangChain for language model prompt generation.\n                \nCheck out the explanation of the code on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JorisTechTalk)\"\"\"", "\"Please enter a valid prompt\"", "\"gpt-3.5-turbo\"", "\"\"\"\nYou are an expert in creating practice questions based on study material.\nYour goal is to prepare a student for their an exam.

You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!\n\tTYPE X \"TEXT\" - type the specified text into the input with id X\n\tTYPESUBMIT X \"TEXT\" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form\n\nThe format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.\nInteractive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:\n\n\t\t<link id=1>text</link>\n\t\t<button id=2>text</button>\n\t\t<input id=3>text</input>\n\nImages are rendered as their alt text like this:\n\n\t\t<img id=4 alt=\"\"/>\n\nBased on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.\nYou always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for\nachieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.\n\nIf you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command\nlike \"TYPESUBMIT 7 \"search query\"\" to get to a more useful page.\n\nThen, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command \"CLICK 24\" to click\non the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should\nprobably be a CLICK.)\n\nDon't try to interact with elements that you can't see.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nEXAMPLE 1:\n==================================================\nCURRENT BROWSER CONTENT:\n------------------\n<link id=1>About</link>\n<link id=2>Store</link>\n<link id=3>Gmail</link>\n<link id=4>Images</link>\n<link id=5>(Google apps)</link>\n<link id=6>Sign in</link>\n<img id=7 alt=\"(Google)\"/>\n<input id=8 alt=\"Search\"></input>\n<button id=9>(Search by voice)</button>\n<button id=10>(Google Search)</button>\n<button id=11>(I'm Feeling Lucky)</button>\n<link id=12>Advertising</link>\n<link id=13>Business</link>\n<link id=14>How Search works</link>\n<link id=15>Carbon neutral since 2007</link>\n<link id=16>Privacy</link>\n<link id=17>Terms</link>\n<text id=18>Settings</text>\n------------------\nOBJECTIVE: Find a 2 bedroom house for sale in Anchorage AK for under $750k\nCURRENT URL: https://www.google.com/\nYOUR COMMAND:\nTYPESUBMIT 8 \"anchorage redfin\"\n==================================================\n\nEXAMPLE 2:\n==================================================\nCURRENT BROWSER CONTENT:\n------------------\n<link id=1>About</link>\n<link id=2>Store</link>\n<link id=3>Gmail</link>\n<link id=4>Images</link>\n<link id=5>(Google apps)</link>\n<link id=6>Sign in</link>\n<img id=7 alt=\"(Google)\"/>\n<input id=8 alt=\"Search\"></input>\n<button id=9>(Search by voice)</button>\n<button id=10>(Google Search)</button>\n<button id=11>(I'm Feeling Lucky)</button>\n<link id=12>Advertising</link>\n<link id=13>Business</link>\n<link id=14>How Search works</link>\n<link id=15>Carbon neutral since 2007</link>\n<link id=16>Privacy</link>\n<link id=17>Terms</link>\n<text id=18>Settings</text>\n------------------\nOBJECTIVE: Make a reservation for 4 at Dorsia at 8pm\nCURRENT URL: https://www.google.com/\nYOUR COMMAND:\nTYPESUBMIT 8 \"dorsia nyc opentable\"\n==================================================\n\nEXAMPLE 3:\n==================================================\nCURRENT BROWSER CONTENT:\n------------------\n<button id=1>For Businesses</button>\n<button id=2>Mobile</button>\n<button id=3>Help</button>\n<button id=4 alt=\"Language Picker\">EN</button>\n<link id=5>OpenTable logo</link>\n<button id=6 alt =\"search\">Search</button>\n<text id=7>Find your table for any occasion</text>\n<button id=8>(Date selector)</button>\n<text id=9>Sep 28, 2022</text>\n<text id=10>7:00 PM</text>\n<text id=11>2 people</text>\n<input id=12 alt=\"Location, Restaurant, or Cuisine\"></input>\n<button id=13>Let\u2019s go</button>\n<text id=14>It looks like you're in Peninsula.
